Python implementation of a basic finance system concept that allows users to buy, sell, and transfer currencies. It includes a JSON database to store user information and currency balances.

### NodeJS Vinyl Manager
Created this because I wanted to keep track of my albums. When buying new records I had to make sure I did not have that album or song already. With this I could solve my problem easily.

If I want to listen to a certain song I can just write it's name on the search and then easily find it from my by genre organized shelf of albums.

You can explore my vinyl collection at
[Karkkainen.net/records](/records).
