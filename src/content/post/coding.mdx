### Digital Banking System Concept with NodeJS

A peer-to-peer digital banking system designed for secure and efficient management of transactions and accounts. This system leverages cryptographic signatures and a distributed chain of data blocks interconnected to handle secure user authentication, account creation, fund transfers, and balances. It ensures data integrity and confidentiality through advanced cryptographic techniques, offering users a reliable and transparent banking experience.

### NodeJS Vinyl Manager

Created this because I wanted to keep track of my albums. When buying new records I had to make sure I did not have that album or song already. With this I could solve my problem easily.

If I want to listen to a certain song I can just write it's name on the search and then easily find it from my by genre organized shelf of albums.

You can explore my vinyl collection at
