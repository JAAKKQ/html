                                <p>Hello, my fellow Americans. I'm sorry to say that the server and all services will be
                                    down for the rest of the week. And let me tell you, it's not my fault, believe me.
                                </p>
                                <p>It's those darn hackers, folks. They're constantly trying to attack our great
                                    American servers, but don't worry, we're going to make them pay. We're going to
                                    build a wall around our servers, and Mexico is going to pay for it.</p>
                                <p>But in the meantime, we have to take our server offline to make sure those hackers
                                    can't do any more damage. And let me tell you, it's going to be huge. The biggest
                                    shutdown you've ever seen, folks. It's going to be yuge.</p>
                                <p>But don't worry, we've got the best team of experts working on this. They're going to
                                    make sure our server is back online and running better than ever. And when it comes
                                    back online, let me tell you, it's going to be fantastic. It's going to be
                                    tremendous.</p>
                                <p>So please, bear with us for the rest of the week. And remember, we're doing this for
                                    the good of our great American server. And together, we're going to make America
                                    great again. Thank you, and God bless America.</p>
