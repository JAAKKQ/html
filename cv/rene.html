"<span id="k">Hey there, nice to see you here.</span>" My name is Rene Kärkkäinen.
<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>
  I am a student at Business College Helsinki, pursuing a vocational degree in IT and high school at the same time, balancing both academic and practical education.
</p>
<p>
  I am very laid back and try to approach situations with positivity and humor. 
  <br /><br /><br />I am passionate about cyber security, the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. I have learned some basic concepts and skills in cyber security, such as encryption, authentication, and network security. I have completed various courses and certificates in these areas.
  <br /><br /><br />I have also worked at WithSecure (formerly F-Secure), the leading cyber security company in the nordics. I have learned how to use cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to create secure and scalable systems and applications.
  <br><br><br>I am seeking opportunities in IT, especially in cyber security, data analysis, or machine learning, where I can also contribute to enhancing the cyber security of the systems and applications I work on. I work well in a team, learn quickly, and solve problems effectively.
