"<span id="k">Hey there, nice to see you here.</span>" My name is Rene Kärkkäinen.
<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>
  I am a student at Business College Helsinki, pursuing a vocational degree in IT and high school at the same time, balancing both academic and practical education.
</p>
<p>
  I am very laid back and try to approach situations with positivity and humor. 
  <br /><br /><br />I am passionate about cyber security, the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. I have learned some basic concepts and skills in cyber security, such as encryption, authentication, and network security. I have completed various courses and certificates in these areas.
  <br /><br /><br />I have also worked at WithSecure (formerly F-Secure), the leading cyber security company in the nordics. I have learned how to use cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to create secure and scalable systems and applications.
  <br><br><br>I have set up my own home lab, building my server network from scratch with a physical server running ESXi. To organize and secure the network, within the ESXi environment, I've configured pfSense as the firewall. Inside pfSense, there's not only OpenVPN servers for remote access but also DHCP and DNS servers. Additionally, I've implemented Suricata for intrusion detection and prevention. To further organize and secure the home lab network effectively, I've utilized VLANs to create multiple isolated networks.
  <br><br><br>On the ESXi server, I've deployed TrueNAS Scale, which is connected to ESXi's file system via NFS, serving as redundant server storage. Furthermore, there is an Ubuntu Server dedicated to hosting the NGINX web server for my websites and some organizational sites. Another Ubuntu Server is designated for testing and running untrusted code.
  <br><br><br>Each server operates on networks designed for specific use cases. For example, the Web Server operates on the "Secure" Network, while the Ubuntu Server for testing is on the "Unsecure" Network. ESXi, pfSense, and TrueNAS operate on the "Trusted" network. I've also established my own certificate authority, which I use to create certificates for the servers. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of network configuration, ensuring smooth DNS resolution, troubleshooting DHCP issues, and addressing challenges in various other components of the system. These practical encounters have proven invaluable in honing my skills and maintaining the robustness of the entire home lab setup.
  <br><br><br>I am seeking opportunities in IT from all over the world, especially in cyber security, data analysis, or machine learning, where I can also contribute to enhancing the cyber security of the systems and applications I work on. I work well in a team, learn quickly, and solve problems effectively.
